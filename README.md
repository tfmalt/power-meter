## Iteration 1: Build the circuit

* Build a cirucit with a photoresistor using arduino.
* Verify I get a predictable digital (HIGH|LOW) pulse measuring a red led.
  Yes.
* Verify the arduino uno loop is fast enough to measure my power meter.
  YES. Appox 90000 iterations per second.

## Iteration 2: Write the arduino program

* Write short ardinuo program to 

## Iteration 3: Start the node.js program interfacing the serialport

## Iteration 4: Create a webapp for the service

## Iteration 5: Install Varnish in front of the web app.

## Iteration 6: Move webapp to angular.js and add form to update actual power meter reading.

## Iteration 7: Migrate events to websocket.
